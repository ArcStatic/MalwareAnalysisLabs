Lab 3-1:

1. The malware only has ExitProcess as an import. Definitely packed, Lab03-01.exe is just a wrapper. 

Strings:
!This program cannot be run in DOS mode.
ExitProcess
kernel32.dll
CONNECT %s:%i HTTP/1.0
advapi32
ntdll
user32
StubPath
SOFTWARE\Classes\htpp\shell\open\commandV

2. Comparing the Regshot snapshots before and after execution, 3 keys and 48 values have been added. 9 values have been modified, but 2 of those are RNG seeds and can definitely be discounted since they change constantly anyway.

The first value added is:
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\VideoDriver: ...[string of hex here]...

This means Lab03-01.exe set the key 'VideoDriver' to run every time the user logs on.

Procmon shows a large number of processes. Three types of registry-related functions are being called - RegOpenKey, RegQueryValue, RegCloseKey - but the only registry values being set are RNG seeds and the VideoDriver value listed above. The only WriteFile process called writes vmx32to64.exe immediately before this registry value change.

Looking at this location, vmx32to64.exe has indeed been written to the system32 folder. So Lab03-01.exe has installed an executable is set to run at system startup.

3. Wireshark has picked up several packets which seem to be anywhere between 120 and 500 seconds apart. There are two repeating announcements being broadcast: Domain/Workgroup and Local Master. These are consistently 258 and 250 bytes in length respectively.

No Netcat output on port 80.

Netcat output over port 443 is inconsistent garbage. No apparent signals or custom protocols here.
