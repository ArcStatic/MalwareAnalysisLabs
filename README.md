# Malware Analysis Labs
Lab exercises from the textbook 'Practical Malware Analysis'

**WARNING: code required for exercises is malicious, only run within a VM completely isolated from outside connections and host machine**

This is a repo to mark my progress working through this book. Techniques used cover both static and dynamic malware analysis and the programs were run using 3 virtual machines on an internal virtual network:
- Patient zero: Windows XP Pro SP3, analysis tools and malware executed here
- Hapless victim: vanilla Windows XP Pro SP3 install, to see if/how a malicious program spreads
- Fake server: Linux Mint 18.1 running INetSim

Files in the repo are harmless .txt writeups, nothing to be scared of here.

- Chapter 3: Basic dynamic analysis techniques
