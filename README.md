Lab exercises from the textbook 'Practical Malware Analysis'

**WARNING: code required for exercises is malicious, only run within a VM completely isolated from outside connections and host machine**

This is a repo to mark my progress working through this book. Techniques used cover both static and dynamic malware analysis.

Files in the repo are harmless .txt writeups, nothing to be scared of here.
